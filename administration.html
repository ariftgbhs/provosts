        <h1>Message from 𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐥-𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐨𝐬𝐭</h1>
       
        <P>The Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET) started its journey with the core mission of developing quality human resources in the field of engineering and technology to serve the nation and the world. It has been accumulating this kudos over the period of 47 years since its inception as engineering college in 1968. At present, the university has 15 departments and 2 research centers. About 700 undergraduate students get admission into 9 degree awarding departments every year and the graduate programs (MSc, MEng, MPhill, PhD) are running under 8 departments.</P>
        <p>To fulfill our central mission, we are inducing the brightest students in our undergraduate academic programs, through highly competitive admission test. Academic programs are complemented with the commitment to provide our students a global career by the frequently updated curricula. In addition to our dedicated faculty, the students are able to gather hands-on industry's experience as CUET is enjoying geographical advantages as the solitary engineering university at the south-east region of the country. Chittagong region holds its eminence for the country's premier sea-port, myriad of heavy and light industries. </p>
        <p>In addition to the above, we are equally putting emphasis on joint collaboration in research programs with the number of internationally leading universities and institutions. As a disaster prone country, we have already started research based graduate program in disaster and environmental engineering, and set up an earthquake engineering research center with the assistance of our global partners. Nevertheless, CUET is invariably focusing on more industry-academia relationships for the sake of invention and building leadership. I am pleased to apprise you that our alumni are now at the helm of significant number of prestigious national and international positions.</p>
        <p>Finally, I look forward to warm welcoming you at naturally pristine CUET campus.</p>
